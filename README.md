# 📚 skeumorphism-studies

> skeuomorph: an ornament or design representing a utensil or implement

This is a project that uses physical objects to communicates UX (User Experience) and IxD (Interaction Design) principles.
The goal is to explore these concepts and educate others on how physical objects might inform our digital experiences,
without tying them down to some of the same norms that physical experiences sometimes have. To be clear, many norms _should_
transfer, but some physical norms (like some physics principles) limit our capabilities digitally.

My target audience is front-end devs, but I aim to discuss the implications for various agile team roles.

Each study will have a place in a CodeSandbox that one can explore the study and read the notes along with it. 😊
The notes are in markdown and can be read on their own. I'll link directly to the notes from here as well.

So that's the goal. Here's a list of what to expect throughout the README.

## 🌤 Inspiration

Main source of inspiration comes from my fellow designers that I've worked with at [Crema](https://www.crema.us). But I've found
inspiration from another of other sources. I imagine this list will grow over time, but here are the big mentions.

- [CLIG](https://clig.dev/)
- [Neilson Norman Group NN/g](https://www.nngroup.com/)
- Specifically, Don Norman's book [The Design of Everyday Things](https://jnd.org/the-design-of-everyday-things-revised-and-expanded-edition/)
